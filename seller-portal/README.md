# Provider Portal — `frontdoor/provider-portal/`

Single-file web bundle implementing the seller-facing provider portal
per [SPEC-014](../../specs/SPEC-014-provider-portal.md).

## Files

- `index.html` — the entire bundle (inline JS + CSS, no build step, no
  CDN). Renders all five surfaces (Machine, Setup & Updates, Earn,
  Monitoring placeholder, Identity).
- `portal-config.json.example` — copy to `portal-config.json` at the
  portal host root and edit before deploying. The portal fails CLOSED
  if `portal-config.json` is missing or malformed (SPEC-014 §2.3).
- `check-bundle.sh` — build-time grep guard for AC 8(b) (operator-key
  isolation) + AC 8(f) (single-machine copy hygiene). Exits 0 on
  clean bundle, 1 on prohibited match, 2 if `index.html` is missing.
  CI MUST run this before serving the file (see "CI" below).
- `README.md` — this file.

## Operator deploy

1. Copy `portal-config.json.example` to `portal-config.json` at the
   portal host root (served at `/portal-config.json`). Edit the three
   keys to match your deployment:
   - `coordinator_base_url` — the coordinator origin (e.g.
     `https://coordinator.streamvc.live`).
   - `releases_repo_owner_name` — GitHub `owner/name` slug (must match
     `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$`).
   - `require_provider_tokens` — strict boolean `true`. The portal
     refuses to start in any other mode (SPEC-014 §2.4 and §2.3).
   The loader rejects any unknown top-level key.
2. Host `index.html` alongside an operator-owned reverse proxy on the
   SAME origin that forwards `/v1/pool/check` and
   `/providers/{id}/earnings` to the coordinator (SPEC-014 §3 +
   Open Q9). If the proxy is missing, the portal renders a loud red
   banner naming §3 / Open Q9 and refuses to fall back to an absolute
   coordinator URL.
3. Run `./check-bundle.sh` (locally or in CI) before serving. The
   script exits 0 on a clean bundle.

## CI

CI MUST run `frontdoor/provider-portal/check-bundle.sh` on any PR
that touches files under `frontdoor/provider-portal/`. The repo's
CI hook lives outside this directory and is added in a follow-up
operator step (see SPEC-014 §10.4 operator runbook).

## Auth model summary

- **AUTH-1 (sign-in):** provider pastes `provider_id` AND
  `provider_token`. Stored in JS module scope only. Page reload returns
  to sign-in. Sign-out clears all session state.
- **AUTH-2 (status handling):** authenticated calls send
  `Authorization: Bearer <provider_token>` and embed `provider_id` in
  the path. 401 → sign back out; 403 and 404 render identical
  "sign-in rejected" copy so the user cannot tell which fired.
  After two consecutive 401/403/404 on the SAME surface in the
  SAME session, the sign-in screen adds a stale-config notice.
- **AUTH-3 (deployment-mode loader):** fail-CLOSED loader for
  `/portal-config.json`. Missing file, non-200, malformed JSON,
  unknown top-level key, non-`true` `require_provider_tokens` →
  unavailable page with zero further network calls.

## Phase status

- **Phase 1A:** scaffold, AUTH-3 loader, AUTH-1 sign-in, AUTH-2
  handling, stale-config guard, Surface A (Machine).
- **Phase 1B:** Surface B (Setup & Updates: requirements grid,
  RAM-to-model sizing card, numbered setup steps, GitHub Releases
  feed with rate-limit + CORS fail-loud).
- **Phase 1C:** Surfaces C (Earn) + D (Monitoring placeholder) +
  E (Identity) + `check-bundle.sh` build-time grep guard.

v0.2 reopens once SPEC-014's Open Qs land their owning-spec
amendments. v0.1 is intentionally narrow.
